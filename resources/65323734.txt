FINAL TERMS Prohibition of Sales to EEA and UK Retail Investors – The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the "EEA") or the United Kingdom (the "UK"). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended or superseded, "MiFID II"); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended or superseded), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended or superseded, the "Prospectus Regulation"). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended or superseded, the "PRIIPs Regulation") for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or the UK may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. MIFID II product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market – Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a "distributor") should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. Notification under Section 309b(1) of the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289) of Singapore – Solely for the purposes of discharging its obligations pursuant to sections 309B(1)(a) and 309B(1)(c) of the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289) of Singapore (the "SFA"), the Issuer has determined, and hereby notifies all relevant persons (as defined in section 309A of the SFA), that the Notes are prescribed capital markets products (as defined in the Securities and Futures (Capital Markets Products) Regulations 2018) and Excluded Investment Products (as defined in MAS Notice SFA 04-N12: Notice on the Sale of Investment Products and MAS Notice FAA-N16: Notice on Recommendations on Investment Products).

PART B – OTHER INFORMATION 1 LISTING (i) Admission to trading: Application has been made by the Issuer (or on its behalf) for the Notes to be admitted to trading on the regulated market of the London Stock Exchange with effect from 4 December 2020. (ii) Estimate of total expenses related to admission to trading: 2 RATINGS The Notes to be issued are expected to be rated: S&P Global Ratings Europe Limited ("S&P"): A- Moody’s Investors Service Limited ("Moody’s"): A1 Obligations rated ‘A’ by S&P are judged to be somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher-rated categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitments on the obligation is still strong. The addition of a minus (-) sign is to show relative standing within this rating category.1 Obligations rated ‘A’ by Moody’s are judged to be upper-medium grade and are subject to low credit risk. The modifier ‘1’ indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category.2 3 4 INTERESTS OF NATURAL AND LEGAL PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE ISSUE Save as discussed in the Prospectus under the heading "Subscription and Sale", so far as the Issuer is aware, no person involved in the issue of the Notes has an interest material to the offer.

Note that the designation "yes" simply means that the Notes are intended upon issue to be deposited with one of the ICSDs as common safekeeper and does not necessarily mean that the Notes will be recognised as eligible collateral for Eurosystem monetary policy and intraday credit operations by the Eurosystem either upon issue or at any or all times during their life. Such recognition will depend upon the ECB being satisfied that Eurosystem eligibility criteria have been met. 0010155-0003129 UKO2: 2001639485.5 6
