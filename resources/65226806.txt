EXECUTION VERSION PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA AND UK RETAIL INVESTORS – The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area ("EEA") or the United Kingdom (the "UK"). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended "MiFID II"); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the "Insurance Distribution Directive"), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the "Prospectus Regulation"). Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (the "PRIIPs Regulation") for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. An investment in the Notes does not have the status of a bank deposit and is not within the scope of the deposit protection scheme operated by the Central Bank of Ireland. The Issuer is not and will not be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland as a result of issuing the Notes. MIFID II PRODUCT GOVERNANCE / PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS AND ECPS ONLY TARGET MARKET - Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer's product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a "distributor") should take into consideration the manufacturers' target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers' target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

(ii) Estimate of total expenses related to admission to trading: EUR 600 (listing fee) 2 RATINGS The Notes to be issued are expected to be rated: Moody's Investors Service Ltd. ("Moody's"): Baa1 S&P Global Ratings Europe Limited ("S&P"): BBB+ In accordance with Moody's ratings definitions available as at the date of these Final Terms, obligations rated "Baa" are judged to be medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category (source: https://www.moodys.com/Pages/amr002002.aspx). In accordance with S&P's ratings definitions available as at the date of these Final Terms, an obligation rated "BBB" exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to weaken the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitments on the obligation. The plus (+) sign shows relative standing within the rating categories (source: https://www.standardandpoors.com/en_US/web/guest/article//view/sourceId/504352). Moody's is established in the United Kingdom and registered under Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies, as amended (the "CRA Regulation"). S&P is established in the European Union and registered under the CRA Regulation. 3 INTERESTS OF NATURAL AND LEGAL PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE ISSUE/OFFER Save for any fees payable to Banco Santander, S.A., Barclays Bank PLC, HSBC Bank plc, ING Bank N.V. and Standard Chartered Bank (together, the "Joint Lead Managers"), so far as the Issuer is aware, no person involved in the offer of the Notes has an interest material to the offer.
